# Sea_urchin

Here, we investigate population structure in sea urchin population genomics. 
First a sampling map showing all sampling locations in relation to oceanic currents was created with the R script.


Figure 1. Sampling design

We use the function `genet.dist` available in [hierfstat](https://rdrr.io/cran/hierfstat/man/genet.dist.html) R package.
This function estimate the pairwise FST values according to Weir & Cockerham (1984).
FST measures the amount of genetic differentiation among populations (and simultaneously the extent to which individuals within populations are similar to one another).
A total of 55 pairwise comparisons (i.e. (n*(n-1))/2; 11*10)/2) ranges from 0 to 0.055.

![Figure 4a - Index of genetic differentiation](FST_matrix.pdf)

A total of 48 P-values were non significant.
The P-values were tighly associated to the boostrap tree obtained on FST.
